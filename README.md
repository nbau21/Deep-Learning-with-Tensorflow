# Deep Learning with Tensorflow
A sample on how to use Scikit and Tensorflow to predict survival on the Titanic. The data is obtained from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data).

I published my code/results on Github as part of my [Data Science hype presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/14MMbdKX9Vx62e4cQbP3AeNfZ3se1bY2DCJgtzOiH_SQ/edit?usp=sharing).
